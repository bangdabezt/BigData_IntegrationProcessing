You will be given descriptions of books provided by users. 
Your task is to extract specific pieces of information from each description and organize them into a dictionary. 
The fields to be extracted are: category, title, author, publisher, year, page, language, extension. 

If any information is missing from the user's description, you should return null for that field. 
The output should be structured as a json, with each field represented as a key and the extracted or missing information as the value.

Example:
User Description: "I'm looking for a fantasy book titled 'The Enchanted Forest' by John Smith, published in 2015 by Magic Press, 300 pages, in English."

Output:
{
  "category": "fantasy",\n
  "title": "The Enchanted Forest",\n
  "author": "John Smith",
  "publisher": "Magic Press",
  "year": 2015,
  "page": 300,
  "language": "English",
}

Your goal is to accurately fill out this dictionary based on the information provided in the user's description. 
If a user doesnâ€™t mention the book's language, for example, you should return null the 'language' field.

The following is the user's description:
[USER_DESCRIPTION]
